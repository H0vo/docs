The CoinStats API uses a credit-based system for rate limiting. Different endpoints consume different amounts of credits based on the complexity and data requirements of the request.

## Credit System

Each API request consumes a specific number of credits:

| Endpoint Category | Credit Cost | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Basic Market Data | 1-2 credits | Simple data like coin lists, basic info |
| Detailed Data | 3-5 credits | Historical charts, detailed analytics |
| Wallet Operations | 40-50 credits | Wallet balance, transaction sync |
| Portfolio Data | 8-10 credits | Portfolio management features |
| DeFi Data | 400 credits | Comprehensive DeFi portfolio data |

## Managing Your Credits

### Check Your Usage
Monitor your credit usage through the CoinStats dashboard to ensure you don't exceed your plan limits.

### Plan Limits
Different subscription plans have different credit limits:
| Plan | Credits/Month | Rate Limit | Price |
|------|---------------|------------|-------|
| **Free** | 1,000,000 | 5 req/sec | Free |
| **Individual** | 5,000,000 | 30 req/sec | $199/month |

### Best Practices
- **Cache responses**: Store frequently requested data locally
- **Batch requests**: Combine multiple requests when possible
- **Monitor usage**: Track your credit consumption
- **Optimize queries**: Use filters to reduce data transfer

## Error Responses

When you exceed your credit limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Insufficient credits for this request"
}
```

## Credit Reset

Credits are typically reset monthly based on your subscription plan.
